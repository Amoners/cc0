#cc0 and libi0

cc0 is a compiler targeting [Layer Zero](http://www.lazero.net/) which is a general-purpose substrate for cloud computing.

libi0 is a general library for writing c0 code targeted [i0](http://www.lazero.net/).

cc0 compiles c0 code to i0 code. c0 is a variation of the C programming language with some extentions to support language-level multi-tasking and other mechanisms in Layer Zero. i0 is a ISA for Layer Zero which unifies myriads of nodes in the datacenters to form a big virtual machine.
