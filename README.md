cc0 is a compiler targeting [Layer Zero](http://www.lazero.net/) which is a general-purpose substrate for cloud computing.

cc0 compiles c0 code to i0 code. c0 is a variation of the C programming language with some extentions to support language-level multi-tasking and other mechanisms in Layer Zero. i0 is a ISA for Layer Zero which unifies myriads of nodes in the datacenters to form a big virtual machine.

cc0 is designed and implemented in the [ECSA](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~lingu/ecsa/) group.
